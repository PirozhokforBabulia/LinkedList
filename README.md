# LinkedList basics
Linked list is array of some values (in this case int) that are connected to each other 
instead of being in one place in memory like array they are spread out all around your memory
# advantage of LinkedList 
It's faster to add data than basic array, especially in begining of the list
in basic array you would have to create new array with 1 more value to just add one 
# disadvantages of LinkedList 
It's slower to find data than basic array. Beacuse of spread out values you have to find those from begining (head) 
in basic array those value are faster to finnd due to them being close to each other 
# Where to use it?
in projects with data that are more changing than using or in projects where you need right now data often but also save some old for other needs
